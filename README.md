Checks to ensure that password adheres to the following standards:

  NIST recently updated their Digital Identity Guidelines in June 2017. The new guidelines specify general rules for handling the security   of user supplied passwords. Previously passwords were suggested to have certain composition rules (special characters, numbers, etc),       hints and expiration times. Those have gone out the window and the new suggestions are as follows:

  Passwords MUST

  Have an 8 character minimum
  AT LEAST 64 character maximum
  Allow all ASCII characters and spaces (unicode optional)
  Not be a common password
